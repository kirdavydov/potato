      <h1>Main information about potatoes</h1><br>
      <br><h3>Health benefits</h3><br>
      <p>
        1. I potatoes contain antioxidants which are very good for your skin.<br><br>

        2. Potatoes contain a special type of starch known as resistant starch. This starch is not broken down and fully absorbed by the body.<br>
        Instead, it reaches the large intestine where it becomes a source of nutrients for the beneficial bacteria in your gut.<br><br>

        3. Certain types of potatoes, particularly red and russet ones, may contain high levels of flavonoid antioxidants and vitamin A,<br>
        like zeaxanthin and carotenes, and they may possibly protect you against many types of cancer.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h3>Different types of potatoes</h3>
      <p>
        Even tho there are more than 200 kinds of potatoes we put the most important ones.<br><br>
        Russet Burbank is a variety of potato with dark brown skin and few eyes that is the most widely grown potato in North America.<br>
        Its meat is white, dry, and floury, and it is good for baking, mashing, and chips. It is a common and popular potato.<br><br>

        The Kennebec potato is an early to late maturing variety of white potato.<br>
        It is characterised by rapid growth, resulting in high yields. We normally use it to make potato omelette.<br><br>
        Yukon Gold potatoes the best choice for classic dense mashed potatoes.<br>
        Their rich texture and subtle creaminess make them great for all of your mashing needs. Waxy potatoes are best for potato salad.<br><br>

        In-between varieties that work for potato salad include Yellow Finn, white and Yukon Gold potatoes.<br>
        Most people should avoid starchy potatoes, like Russets, because they'll fall apart instead of maintaining their shape.<br>
