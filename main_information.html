  <h1>Main information about potatoes</h1>
  <h3>Health benefits</h3>
  <p>
    1. I potatoes contain antioxidants which are very good for your skin<br><br>

    2. Potatoes contain a special type of starch known as resistant starch<br>
    This starch is not broken down and fully absorbed by the body.<br>
    Instead, it reaches the large intestine where it becomes a source of nutrients for the beneficial bacteria in your gut<br><br>

    3. Certain types of potatoes, particularly red and russet ones,<br>
    may contain high levels of flavonoid antioxidants and vitamin A,<br>
    like zeaxanthin and carotenes, and they may possibly protect you against many types of cancer.<br><br>

    Even tho there are more than 200 kinds of potatoes we put the most important ones.<br><br>
    Russet Burbank is a variety of potato with dark brown skin and few eyes that is the most widely grown potato in North America.<br>
    Its meat is white, dry, and floury, and it is good for baking, mashing, and chips.<br>

    The Kennebec potato is an early to late maturing variety of white potato.<br>
    It is characterized by rapid growth, resulting in high yields. We normally use it to make potato omelette.<br><br>
    Yukon Gold potatoes the best choice for classic dense mashed potatoes.<br>
    Their rich texture and subtle creaminess make them great for all of your mashing needs. Waxy potatoes are best for potato salad.<br><br>
    In-between varieties that work for potato salad include Yellow Finn, white and Yukon Gold potatoes.<br>
    Most people should avoid starchy potatoes, like Russets, because they'll fall apart instead of maintaining their shape.<br>
