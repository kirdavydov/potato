      <h3>Different types of potatoes</h3>
      <p>
        Even though there are more than 200 kinds of potatoes we put the most important ones.<br><br>
        Russet Burbank is a variety of potato with dark brown skin and few eyes that is the most widely grown potato in North America.<br>
        Its meat is white, dry, and floury, and it is good for baking, mashing, and chips. It is a common and popular potato.<br><br>

        The Kennebec potato is an early to late maturing variety of white potato.<br>
        It is characterised by rapid growth, resulting in high yields. We normally use it to make potato omelette.<br><br>
        Yukon Gold potatoes the best choice for classic dense mashed potatoes.<br>
        Their rich texture and subtle creaminess make them great for all of your mashing needs. Waxy potatoes are best for potato salad.<br><br>

        In-between varieties that work for potato salad include Yellow Finn, white and Yukon Gold potatoes.<br>
        Most people should avoid starchy potatoes, like Russets, because they'll fall apart instead of maintaining their shape.<br>
